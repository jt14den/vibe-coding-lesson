## Glossary

Agent
: An AI system capable of using tools (like reading files, running code, or searching the web) to complete autonomous tasks.

Chain of Thought
: A prompting technique that encourages the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step, often leading to more accurate results for complex logic.

CLEAR Framework
: A prompt engineering model (Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, Reflective) developed by Leo Lo to optimize AI interactions.

CLI (Command Line Interface)
: A text-based interface for interacting with your computer's operating system.

CO-STAR Framework
: A popular prompt engineering framework (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response) developed by Sheila Teo, emphasizing the importance of persona and audience.

Context Window
: The limit on the amount of text (measured in tokens) an AI model can process and "remember" at one time.

Few-shot Prompting
: Providing a few examples in the prompt to guide the AI's output (e.g., giving 3 examples of good titles before asking for a new one).

Hallucination
: When an AI generates factually incorrect or nonsensical information confidently.

LLM (Large Language Model)
: A deep learning model trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude).

OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
: A common method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model.

Synthetic Data
: Artificially generated data used for testing validation pipelines without risking sensitive real-world data.

Vibe Coding
: A playful term for using AI to handle the "grunt work" of coding (writing boilerplate, refactoring, cleaning data) while the human researcher focuses on high-level logic, strategy, and verification.

Zero-shot Prompting
: Asking the AI to perform a task without providing any examples.
