AI-Assisted Programming with Validation Best Practices.

This lesson introduces researchers to **Vibe Coding**—the practice of using AI agents and CLI tools to accelerate research software development while maintaining high standards of scientific validation.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the command line (navigating directories, running commands).
- Fundamental understanding of Python (variables, functions, scripts).
- No prior experience with AI coding agents is required.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Objectives

- Install and authenticate the Gemini CLI.
- Understand the advantages of autonomous agents over simple chat interfaces.
- Apply the CLEAR and CONTEXT frameworks for effective prompting.
- Implement five key validation strategies: Synthetic Data, Theoretical, Cross-AI, Unit Testing, and Documentation.
