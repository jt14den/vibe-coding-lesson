AI-Assisted Programming with Validation Best Practices.

This lesson introduces researchers to **Vibe Coding**—the practice of using AI agents and CLI tools to accelerate research software development while maintaining high standards of scientific validation.

## Questions
- What is CLI-based AI and how does it differ from browser chats?
- How can I install and use the Gemini CLI?
- What are the best practices for prompting in a research context?
- How can I validate AI-generated code to ensure scientific integrity?

## Objectives
- Install and authenticate the Gemini CLI.
- Understand the advantages of autonomous agents over simple chat interfaces.
- Apply the CLEAR and CONTEXT frameworks for effective prompting.
- Implement five key validation strategies: Synthetic Data, Theoretical, Cross-AI, Unit Testing, and Documentation.
