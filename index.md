AI-Assisted Programming with Validation Best Practices.

This lesson introduces researchers to **Vibe Coding**—the practice of using AI agents and CLI tools to accelerate research software development while maintaining high standards of **software correctness and reproducibility**.

## What is "Vibe Coding"?

Coined by Andrej Karpathy, **Vibe Coding** is a shift in how we build software. Instead of writing every line of code manually, you guide an AI agent using natural language to generate, test, and refine your project.

For researchers, this means:

- **Less Typing, More Thinking**: You focus on the *logic* and *science* (the "vibe" of the analysis), while the AI handles the syntax.
- **From Writer to Editor**: Your role shifts from writing code from scratch to reviewing and verifying AI-generated code.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: You can test hypotheses and build pipelines in minutes rather than days.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the command line (navigating directories, running commands).
- Fundamental understanding of Python (variables, functions, scripts).
- No prior experience with AI coding agents is required.

## Objectives

- Install and authenticate the Gemini CLI.
- Understand the advantages of autonomous agents over simple chat interfaces.
- Apply the CLEAR and CONTEXT frameworks for effective prompting.
- Implement five key validation strategies: Synthetic Data, Theoretical, Cross-AI, Unit Testing, and Documentation.
