## The AI Tool Landscape

### Coding Tools

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI (competitor to Gemini CLI).
- **GitHub Copilot**: IDE-integrated autocomplete.
- **Cursor**: A full code editor with built-in AI.

### Research-Specific Tools

- **Elicit**: Paper discovery and data extraction.
- **Consensus**: Searching for scientific consensus.
- **NotebookLM**: Chatting with your own research PDFs.

## Extending Capabilities

While we focused on the CLI, the ecosystem is evolving to let AI tools "reach out" to other software.

*   **Browser Extensions (Plugins)**: Tools like ChatGPT and Gemini (in browser) often have "extensions" to connect with Google Drive, Kayak, or WolframAlpha.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: This is an emerging open standard (adopted heavily by **Claude** and others) that lets you connect an AI assistant to *any* local or remote data source—like your PostgreSQL database, your Slack, or your local file system—without uploading everything. It is the "USB-C port" for AI applications.

## Summary Checklist

1. [ ] **CLI tools** operate directly on your files—use them for multi-step tasks.
2. [ ] **GEMINI.md** provides the persistent context your agent needs.
3. [ ] **CLEAR/CONTEXT** frameworks improve your results.
4. [ ] **Validate** using synthetic data and statistical theory.
5. [ ] **You are the pilot**; the AI is the co-pilot.
