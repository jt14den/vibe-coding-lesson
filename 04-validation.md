## Trust but Verify

AI writes the code, but **you** validate it. Never trust AI output without verification.

### 1. Synthetic Data Validation
Generate data with **known** parameters (e.g., you define the slope as 2.0) and see if the AI's code can recover those exact values. If the code can't find the truth when you know it, it won't find it in your real research data.

### 2. Theoretical Validation
Check if the code respects statistical laws. For example:
- Does the Standard Error (SE) halve when the sample size $n$ quadruples ($1/\sqrt{n}$)?
- Does the SE scale proportionally with noise?
- Does duplicating data (adding no new info) correctly leave the coefficients unchanged but potentially flag issues with SE?

### 3. Cross-AI Validation
Get a "second opinion". Take the code generated by Gemini and ask Claude or ChatGPT to review it for mathematical correctness or numerical stability.

### 4. Unit Testing
Ask the AI to generate a `pytest` suite that covers edge cases:
- Empty datasets.
- Perfectly correlated data.
- Constant $X$ or $Y$ values.
- Very large datasets.

### 5. Restructuring & Documentation
Use the AI to make the code maintainable. Ask it to:
- Add NumPy-style docstrings.
- Add type hints.
- Create a `README.md` and `requirements.txt`.
- Organize the code into a proper Python package structure.

## Challenge: Run a Validation

Ask the Gemini CLI to "Create a validation script that generates synthetic data with a slope of 3.5 and intercept of -1.2, then tests if our LinearRegression class recovers these values within 2 standard errors."
